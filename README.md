# hello-world
First GitHub repository

Greetings. I'm Noah and I have great aspirations regarding technology. Being a lifelong user of the Internet and gaming consoles, I have a keen eye for imperfections and I love making improvements. I hope to publish software on GitHub that is legitimately useful, or at the very least, a good stepping stone for future projects.

A very simple idea that I have right now is for an alt code lookup tool. Sometimes while writing a paper or a simple message I want to use a typographical character that isn't available on the keyboard. You've probably used alt codes before. For example, holding the Alt key and typing 0151 on the numpad inserts an em-dash (â€”). I want a program available on my hard drive that enables me to search for these characters and learn the respective alt code, or click on the character to insert it into a text field. I can't find any software that does this. It would save me a needlessly clunky web search. Maybe I'll develop this soon? 

I'm literally starting CS110 today, so I'm quite excited for my future with code. :)
