# hello-world
First GitHub repository

Greetings. I'm Noah and I have great aspirations regarding technology. Being a lifelong user of the Internet and gaming consoles, I have a keen eye for imperfections and I love making improvements. I hope to publish software on GitHub that is legitimately useful, or at the very least, a good stepping stone for future projects.

A very simple idea that I have right now is for an alt code lookup tool. Sometimes while writing a paper or a simple message, I want to use a typographical character that isn't available on the keyboard. You've probably used alt codes before. For example, holding the Alt key and typing 0151 on the numpad inserts an em-dash (â€”). I want a program available on my hard drive that enables me to search for these characters and learn the respective alt code, or click on the character to insert it into a text field. I can't find any software that does this. It would save me a needlessly clunky web search; I avoid trips to my Web browser if I can because I currently have a sluggish download speed. I could access the alt code lookup tool by pressing the Windows key, typing the first few characters of the program name, and pressing enter, which then opens the software and activates a search field so that it is ready for text entry. Maybe I'll develop this soon? 

I'm starting CS110 today, so I'm quite excited for my future with code. :)
